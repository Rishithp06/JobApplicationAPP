    //@OneToMany means one company can have many jobs (a one-to-many relationship).

    //How Does This Work?
//
//    Every company can have multiple jobs.
//
//    The job table will have a company_id column that links to the company table.
    //job table will get company id which maps compamnyiod with job , it wont create a new table which does it , if you didnt do
    //mapped by and then give value a separate table would have been created
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "company")
    //every company has a job so map it

//Why are we passing company in the JSON even though it's not directly mentioned in the schema? ðŸ¤”
//
//Even though the Job entity does not have company_id explicitly mentioned, it is still required because of the @ManyToOne relationship with Company
